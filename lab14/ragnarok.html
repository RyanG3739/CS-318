            <p>The giantess old <br> in Ironwood sat, <br> In the east, and bore <br> the brood of Fenrir; <br> Among these one <br> in monster's guise <br> Was soon to steal <br> the sun from the sky. <br></p>
            <p>There feeds he full <br> on the flesh of the dead, <br> And the home of the gods <br> he reddens with gore; <br> Dark grows the sun, <br> and in summer soon <br> Come mighty storms: <br> would you know yet more? <br></p>

            <h3>Ragnarök</h3>
            <p>
                In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of events, including a great battle, foretold to lead to the death of a number of great figures (including the Gods Odin, Thor, Tör, Freyr, Heimdallr and Loki), natural disasters and the submersion of the world in water. After these events, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors. Ragnarök is an important event in Norse mythology and has been the subject of scholarly discourse and theory in the history of Germanic studies.

            <h3>Valhalla</h3>
            <p>
                In Norse mythology, Valhalla ("hall of the slain") is a majestic, enormous hall located in Asgard, ruled over by the god Odin. Chosen by Odin, half of those who die in combat travel to Valhalla upon death, led by valkyries, while the other half go to the goddess Freyja's field Fölkvangr. In Valhalla, the dead warriors join the masses of those who have died in combat (known as the Einherjar) and various legendary Germanic heroes and kings, as they prepare to aid Odin during the events of Ragnarök. Before the hall stands the golden tree Glasir, and the hall's ceiling is thatched with golden shields. Various creatures live around Valhalla, such as the stag Eikpyrnir and the goat Heidrun, both described as standing atop Valhalla.

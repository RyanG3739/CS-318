            <p>The Galloping Goose was established in 1873 by my great-grandmother, Marike. She
                inherited from her father a 23 acre apple orchard and his prized goose Gertrude at the
                age of 16. In the beginning she would sell cider and pies on the edge of town to the
                villagers. Eventually she saved enough turn the farmhouse at the end of her land into
                The Galloping Goose. Over the last century The Galloping Goose has been handed
                down to the eldest daughter who keeps the legacy of the pub alive</p>
